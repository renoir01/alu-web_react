# TypeScript Project

This project contains a series of TypeScript tasks that demonstrate various TypeScript concepts including interfaces, classes, namespaces, declaration merging, ambient declarations, and nominal typing.

## Tasks Overview

1. **Task 0**: Creating an interface for a student
2. **Task 1**: Building a Teacher interface and extending it
3. **Task 2**: Advanced types and functions
4. **Task 3**: Ambient Namespaces for external libraries
5. **Task 4**: Namespace & Declaration merging
6. **Task 5**: Brand convention & Nominal typing

## Requirements

- TypeScript compiler
- Node.js and npm
- Webpack for bundling

## Setup

Each task directory contains its own configuration files:

- `package.json`: Dependencies and scripts
- `tsconfig.json`: TypeScript compiler options
- `webpack.config.js`: Webpack configuration

## Running the Code

To run any of the tasks:

1. Navigate to the task directory
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Build the project: `npm run build`
4. For tasks with a web interface, use: `npm run start-dev`

## TypeScript Concepts Demonstrated

- Basic types and interfaces
- Classes and inheritance
- Function interfaces
- Advanced types and type predicates
- String literal types
- Ambient namespaces
- Declaration merging
- Nominal typing with brand properties
